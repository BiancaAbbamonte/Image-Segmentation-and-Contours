# Image Segmentation, Contours and Center of Mass
A college study where we needed to segment the first four letters of our names and outline those letters and find the center of mass of those contours.
In my case the letters B, I, A and N.
First I needed to cut the image to isolate just the letters I wanted to work with, after that used cv2 to segment the letters and then I did the contours and calculated the center of mass of those contours.
